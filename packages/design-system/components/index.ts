/**
 * Shared component baseline — to be populated as components are extracted.
 *
 * The following components should be standardized across repos:
 *   - Button (with CVA variants)
 *   - Card (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)
 *   - Badge (default, secondary, destructive, outline)
 *   - Input
 *   - Label
 *   - Dialog
 *   - Table
 *   - Tabs
 *   - Dropdown
 *   - Skeleton
 *   - Spinner
 *
 * For now, each repo uses its own shadcn-generated copies.
 * This barrel export will be the single import point once components are extracted.
